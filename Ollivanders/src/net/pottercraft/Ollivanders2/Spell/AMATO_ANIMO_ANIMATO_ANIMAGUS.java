/**
 * Amato Animo Animato Animagus is an incantation used in the process of becoming an Animagus. The spell alone is
 * not enough to change a player in to an Animagus. The spell has to be recited either at sunrise or sunset
 * and the player must drink the Animagus potion after saying the incantation. The potion must be consumed during
 * a lightning storm. Once the player has successfully become an Animagus it will require considerable practice
 * before they can consistently take the form.
